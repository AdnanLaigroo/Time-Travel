      <p style="">Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime, either to an earlier time or to a later time, without the need for the traveler to experience the intervening period in the usual sense.
Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction. It was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel The Time Machine, which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination. However, it is uncertain if time travel to the past is physically possible. Forward time travel into the future is possible and frequently experienced according to special relativity and general relativity, although advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology.[1] The feasibility of backwards time travel is uncertain. It is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for backwards time travel, but the solutions require conditions that may not be physically possible. Traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only connected with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges.</p>
